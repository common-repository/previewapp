Preview allows you to mark annotations and create tickets on any part of your web or design project - so your team and clients can collaborate.

== Description ==

Preview allows you to mark annotations and create tickets on any part of your web or design project - so your team and clients can collaborate to revise projects online without sending e-mails or spending time looking for the right version or web page.

Our platform is used to manage collaborative projects and all your digital work online.

Preview's simple and intuitive interface bring working with tickets to a new level ! Whichever phase of the project our are currently in (wireframes, design, development, testing) you can use our visual inspector and put your tickets directly where the problem is !

If you need to share one or several mock up, or if you need a demonstration of your tablet or mobile application, Preview gives you the tools to present and drive the development of your creations like no other.
